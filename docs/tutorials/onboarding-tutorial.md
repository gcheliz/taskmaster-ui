## Section 2: Repository Connection

### Step 2.1: Prepare Your Repository

Before connecting, ensure you have a Git repository ready:

1. **Option A - Use an existing project:**
   - Navigate to one of your existing Git repositories
   - Note the full path (e.g., `/Users/yourname/projects/my-app`)

2. **Option B - Create a test repository:**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/taskmaster-tutorial
   cd ~/taskmaster-tutorial
   git init
   echo "# TaskMaster Tutorial" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

**Important:** The repository path must be absolute (starting with `/` on Unix/Linux/macOS or `C:\` on Windows).

### Step 2.2: Connect Your Repository

1. **Click "Add Repository"** in the sidebar
   - A form will appear for repository connection

2. **Enter Repository Path:**
   - Type the full path to your Git repository
   - Example: `/Users/yourname/projects/my-app`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use relative paths like `./my-app`

3. **Submit the Form:**
   - Click "Connect" or "Add" button
   - Wait for validation to complete

**What happens next:**
- TaskMaster validates the path exists
- Checks if it's a valid Git repository
- Verifies read/write permissions
- Adds the repository to your sidebar

### Step 2.3: Verify Repository Connection

**Success indicators:**
- Repository appears in the sidebar with its folder name
- Green status indicator or checkmark
- No error messages displayed

**If connection fails:**
- Check the path is correct and absolute
- Verify the directory contains a `.git` folder
- Ensure you have read/write permissions
- Try using the full absolute path

**Repository Details:**
Click on your repository name in the sidebar to see:
- Repository path
- Connection status
- Available projects (currently none)
